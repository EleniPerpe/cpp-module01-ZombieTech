This repository contains a series of exercises designed to teach fundamental C++ object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as memory management, references, pointers, class creation, and more. Each exercise is meant to help you practice specific C++ features, such as dynamic memory allocation, object relationships, and handling different data types in a structured and modular way.
